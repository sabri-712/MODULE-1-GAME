        Unfriendly stranger continues to stare as your bus approaches, making you feel unsettled.<br>
        More unsettling, is the fact that they get on the bus too, right after you, still appearing menacing.<br>
        You pull out your phone and a portable charger to give you something to do and calm your nerves. You see missed notifications in your Do Not Disturb.<br>
        It is your next-door neighbor and friend. Do you call/text them back or no?
