                You are going home from your first big job in a new city late at night.<br> 
                The city is pretty quiet and mostly empty because of a large festival further away.<br>
                You are waiting at your bus stop when you notice a stranger sitting at the next bus stop staring at you.<br>
                Stranger doesn't seem friendly as you nod and they continue to glare in your direction.<br> 
                You don't make much of it as your bus is less than 5 minutes away and your phone is at 30% charge.<br>
